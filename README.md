# OC_Student_IML_P4
This all the work I've done for OC IML project nÂ°4. The goal was to learn how to use/optimize/adapt/evaluate different clustering algorithms, with an open database about clients of a brezilian purchasing website. In the end, we had to identify custommers profile groups, and evaluate their stabilty through time.
